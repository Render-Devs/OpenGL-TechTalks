# First Demo

Requirements:
 - Couple of quads moving through screen via predefined (discussed) algorithm
 - Each of couple using different drawing strategy (DrawArrays, DrawElements, BaseVertex, RestartPrimitives etc.)
 - Each couple has a unique shader. (for ex. couple of 5 quads drawing as red).
 - Other couples should use different shader strategies (subroutines, separate shader object)
 - Possibility to look on each couple separately via pressed key (up to you what assign to your couple, use/create mapping doc with assigned feature to key.
 - PostProcessing Effects using framebuffer (Gauasian blur, Grayscale, Negative, Gamma Correction)
